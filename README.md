# Rollup base d3

WIP[ðŸ¤–]

Migrating my starter project kit from Gulp to Rollup. The starter kit is ready to work with a reduced version of d3 based on importing only the necessary modules.

postCSS to CSS   
Babel to JS   
Linters: eslint and Stylelint   
browsersync to launch a server   
Lint-staged to linter CSS with Stylelint before push to repository   

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn serve
```

Todo

Shell script like [base](https://github.com/jorgeatgu/base/blob/master/initCSS.sh)   
Remove this error: Error: You must supply options.input to rollup   
[Show notifications(macOs) with errors.](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/rollup-plugin-notify)   
Stylelint and postcss

This warning is annoying but there is no way to eliminate it.
Warning (!) Circular dependency: [issue](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/issues/168)
