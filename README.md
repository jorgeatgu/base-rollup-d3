# Rollup base d3

Wip

Migrating my starter project kit from Gulp to Rollup. The starter kit is ready to work with a reduced version of d3 based on importing only the necessary modules.

postCSS to styles
browsersync to launch a server

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn serve
```

Todo

Shell script like [base](https://github.com/jorgeatgu/base/blob/master/initCSS.sh)
Remove this error: Error: You must supply options.input to rollup
Show notifications(macOs) with errors.
Stylelint

This warning is annoying but there is no way to eliminate it.
Warning (!) Circular dependency: [issue](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/issues/168)
